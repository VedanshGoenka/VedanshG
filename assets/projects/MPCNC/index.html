            >Mostly Printed CNC (MPCNC)</a
            >: a project that serves as a capstone to the passions that I have
            cultivated over the years. I discovered this project during the research
            process for my 3D printer. Over the course of my research, I developed
            strong affinities towards a selection of YouTube content creators, many
            of which I still watch in my spare time. One of these YouTubers,

            Over the course of late 2019 and early 2020, the MPCNC stayed as an
            afterthought in my mind, occasionally coming to the front and offering
            an interesting conversation topic. During the tail-end of the ill-fated
            2019-2020 FRC season, our team was discussing the possibility of
            purchasing a metal capable router as changing the CNC set up from bar
            stock to plate stock took an extremely tedious ~1 hour. During the
            longer meeting this often wasn't a huge concern, but during shorter
            meetings where the queue was as long as the meeting, this one hour queue
            always left some groups dissatisfied and without fabricated parts. After
            Covid-19 prematurely ended the season, talks about purchasing a CNC
            router grew with the administration, but were ultimately shut down due
            to the exorbitant costs and the seemingly little value.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I caught wind that the router proposal had died down, I decided on
            a moonshot idea: to write up a quick pitch for the LowRider 2 CNC and
            market it as not only a metal-capable CNC router, but also a learning
            experience for whomever is involved in its construction. I was invested
            in the concept, but I never expected to receive the overwhelmingly
            positive feedback from the mentors that I received. This extended to the
            administration and by the beginning of summer the MPCNC was a go. Here's
            the one pager that I used in my pitch:
            <a
                    href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18lK35Jdez3V-1zvz7ZYWg8wX-F8Kexc5/view?usp=sharing"

            >LowRider CNC Plans</a
            >
        </p>
        <p>
            In parallel with my other projects over the summer, I spent weeks
            perfecting details of the construction and part selection of the MPCNC.
            One of my close friends had seen the potential of the MPCNC and decided
            to build one for his guitar-making hobby—he wants to turn this into a
            side business. When he surprised me with his progress I felt a wave of
            mixed emotions: shock, amazement, pride, and even a tinge of betrayal,
            but these quickly subsided and were replaced with another emotion:
            ecstasy. I was wholeheartedly interested in how he did it and used him
            as motivation to modify parts and try to out do what he had
            accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sending my proposal to mentors and school administration during the peak
            of summer I wasn't expecting a reply, but I got one within a few days,
            however, it contained bittersweet news. The CNC was fully approved—the
            sweet— but due to Covid-19 the legal department of the school was still
            trying to collect its marbles regarding sending (potentially) dangerous
            tools home with a high-schooler. I was devastated by this, as I thought
            this was the school's way of saying,
            <code>
                “Yo that's a cool idea and if Coronavirus wasn't a thing we'd
                <em>definitely</em> get one for y'all, but since, well Coronavirus, we
                need to pull the plug on this... indefinitely.”
            </code>
            After continually checking in with the robotics mentors bi-weekly I got
            disheartened and eventually stopped asking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Summer ended and distance learning began, during one of the weekly
            robotics meetings I was pleasantly surprised, the CNC was being approved
            as a project. What followed was a long series of logistical emails and
            changes to the format of the project. The CNC was gonna be a multi
            person project, then it became a single person project at the robotics
            lab, and after a few other format changes mostly due to the severity of
            Covid-19 the final format was decided: I would take the kit home and
            work on it in my garage. In mid-November I went to the lab and picked up
            the filament and started the ~60 hours of printing. Shortly before
            winter break, I went in and picked up the supplies for the actual CNC,
            the metal, the motors, the fasteners, the bearings, etc.

            Finally! After almost a year (10 months) of trying to persuade the
            administration and mentors and trying to find a “Covid-19 friendly
            format” I finally had the CNC in my hands and boy was I excited to
            start.

            I started off by inventorying all of the parts to see if anything was
            missing, this did not go as planned. For the motherboard that I bought,
            the stepper motor drivers needed to be purchased separately, and in a
            fantastical miscommunication (I still don't know how this happened)
            rather than buying the required 5 that we needed (or 8 to save on
            costs), we ended up purchasing 24—keep in mind that each of these cost
            ~12 dollars... Besides this everything seemed to be there and I was
            ready to proceed.

        <p>
            I started off my organizing all of the nuts and bolts into ziploc bags
            for easy access. Then I started off by assembling the frame. This was
            something that took a lot of finesse. For each of the parts I need to
            hold 2 heavy metal tubes securely while putting a thin 3d printed spacer
            between them and also tightening 4 bolts evenly (with a lock nut that
            wasn't a captive nut). With my dad's help, the cracking of two of the 3D
            printed pieces—this shouldn't have any impact on the machine, and about
            3 hours, the frame was ready and assembled. I also need to add the x
            -rollers, this took significantly longer than I expected. The bolt had
            to go through plastic-bearing-plastic (or nothing here)-lock-nut and
            with the tight tolerances tightening this assembly took a lot of time as
            I needed to make around ~10 rotations to get adequate pressure. Each
            bolt took ~7-8 min to do, this may seem like not that big of a deal, but
            for just the 4 rollers (pictured below), I need to do this 12 times (+ 4
            more as I forgot to put them in while tightening the rails).

            I then had to continue this bolt- plastic-bearing -plastic-lock nut
            combination for 16 other components (for the Z axis, where Z is up and
            down). This ended up taking me to the end of Day 1 for two reasons: One,
            it was 9 O'clock and I skipped lunch, making me really hungry. And Two,
            I had done almost everything I could have done with the parts that I
            had. I still needed CNC'd wood for the side panels and the carriage (the
            irony of needing CNC'd wood for a CNC. This left me with a rough
            assembly that looked like this:

        <h4>Day 2: 12/22</h4>
        <p>
            After my friend, the one who built the CNC over the summer, used his CNC
            to cut the plywood I needed and dropped it off I was able to continue
            the building process. The holes that he drilled, while in the right spot
            they were nowhere near the right size. To combat this I had to drill the
            holes out, but this presented a problem: drilling plywood has an
            extraordinary chance of splitting, considering that the holes were on
            the edges of the work, I couldn't follow any method that I knew about
            drilling the plywood. I didn't have other pieces of wood that I could
            use as sacrificial surfaces to prevent tear out (I think that's the
            technical term). I had to improvise and since I didn't have any spares I
            had to be extremely careful. After a moment of deliberation I tried a
            few things. Rather than using the final hole size drill bit I worked my
            way up, but when I tried to drill the hole the plywood started to chip,
            dang, that was the only “legit” method that I could think of. I then
            tried something that I remember being told not to do, as it was
            considered a poor idea—woodworkers avert your eyes! I ran the drill bit,
            starting with a smaller size, in reverse until I had slowly gone through
            the board, only after I did this, I was able to turn the drill in the
            right direction and clean up the hole. For each of the 8 holes I had to
            step through 3 sizes of drill bits paying 110% attention to make sure
            that I didn't accidentally wreck these irreplaceable pieces of wood—talk
            about stress!

            After doing this I had to add the 3rd bearing for 8 more assemblies. I
            couldn't have done this earlier as this “bolt sandwich” contained:
            bolt-<strong>plywood</strong>-plastic-bearing-plastic-locknut. It was
            even harder to secure this work as I had a massive piece of plywood that
            I also needed hold. This ended up taking much longer than I anticipated,
            taking 2.5 hours rather than the expected 1.5. After this was all said
            and done I was finished with the side rollers and had an assembly that
            looked like this:

            After I did all of this I had to put the center on the 4 rollers. This
            wasn't as difficult as the other parts, but I was still difficult as the
            alignment of the holes was directly correlated with the tension on the
            rollers. This along with the bolts being just barely long enough gave
            very little room for the nut to engage. This made it much more
            difficult. After mounting the router and the X-axis-controlling stepper
            motor to the plate, which they didn't include enough bolts for so I had
            to look through a pile of spare bolts until I found 4 that worked, I was
            ready to call it for the night, this is when I noticed my mistake. I had
            put the assembly 180° off. I decided to call it for the night anyways, I
            would work on fixing this while I am waiting for the wood glue to dry
            for the sled. This was my progress by the end of day 2, with the
            incorrectly aligned toolhead:mpcnc-ready-another-angle

            What's the saying? There ain't' no rest for the wicked? Well the holiday
            spirit isn't going to divert my focus away from the CNC. I went to Home
            Depot, list in hand, to get all of the wooden pieces that I needed.
            After spending 2 hours cutting the wood and collecting what I needed I
            finally had everything. On a quick tangent, the wood cutting machine
            (for sheets) was really cool. It's called a vertical panel saw and I
            have never saw seen anything like it. I found it really cool how it
            perfectly cut the wood without the normal hassles with a table saw.

            After getting the wood home—I never realized how heavy mdf is— I started
            clamping the wood on top of the table with the intention to start the
            construction of the sled. This is when I realized the huge mistake that
            I made. The 2x4 is actually 1.5 x 3.5, for some reason I thought this
            was 1.5 x 3, as a result of this the 2x4 actually interferes with the
            rollers. The only option that I have is to get the wood re-cut, which is
            gonna take a few days. Until then I decided to finish everything else
            that I can, this included fixing the direction of the tool-head carriage
            and cutting the metal angle that is used to mount the wires. My mistake:

        <h4>Day 4: 12/29</h4>
        <p>
            Oh how I missed working on the CNC. I spent some time (I think partially
            the day before) fixing the center carriage which was flipped 180
            degrees, this took about 20 min and after this was done I had to sort
            out the situation with the wood. I was initially planning on going back
            to home depot either to : a. Get an inch cut of the width of the wood or
            b. Buy smaller wood and get that cut to size; Luckily I had to do
            neither. One of my close friends' dad, who lives technically next door
            (there are a bunch of houses, but they are on another street), was able
            to cut the wood for me. We used a skill saw on the back of his truck bed
            and a few clamps. It made a huge mess, but in the end I was able to cut
            off an inch from the end. The cuts even looked half decent! After
            getting a splinter (or 4) getting the wood back home, I sanded the rough
            parts down and prepped it for assembly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I called my good friend over and we worked together, socially distance
            and with masks, on the glue up and wood screw up. We first put the wood
            roughly where it was supposed to go. After getting one of my sister's
            art brushes (sorry!) I had all the tools for the initial glue up. For
            the initial glue up, we basically moved the 2x4 (now missing an inch, so
            2x3?) 1.5 in. to the left (the 2 is actually 1.5) and then with this
            slit of mdf we put the glue, we then put more glue on the 2x3 (that
            sounds unnatural) and then mated the glued up surfaces together. After
            applying a metric ton of clamps (insert clamp champ meme here), we
            started drilling holes. The drill bit burned me a few times (it got over
            200 degrees fahrenheit!) and after wearing a pair of gloves I was able
            to drill out the remaining holes. You may be asking, why do I need to
            touch the drill bit? Good question, for some reason, the bit keeps on
            falling out of the drill—and yes I have tightened it real good.

            We may have gone overboard (pun intended) making 14 holes (on each
            side!) rather than the needed 6, but <em>shrug</em>. After screwing
            everything in, and removing all the clamps I had a sled that was ready
            to be used, just not in the snow. This was by far the messiest part of
            the whole build and I also enjoyed it the most. The other parts of the
            build felt almost monotonous, don't get me wrong, I loved listening to

            (the first website I made for fun; the link) and tightening bolts for
            10+ hours, but this is <em>slightly</em> more fun. After putting
            everything in, there was one spot where the 2x4 (2x3 whatever, I give
            up) was pretty mangled and sharp (from factory). I didn't think of a
            better solution and ended up following what my dad suggested, put a
            thick layer of wood glue and let it harden, if there is any annoying
            glue, sand it down. I did it and can't really do anything else until
            that is dry. I took a few new photos, here:

        <p>CNC and the table. 👀. Oh yeah, it's all coming together!</p>
        <br/>
        <h4>Day 5: 12/30</h4>
        <p>
            One more day until this sorry excuse for a year can come to close. Man,
            I hope 2020 wasn't a warm-up for 2021. Anyways, the CNC is now
            kinematically ready!
        </p>
        <p>
            After vacuuming any excess sawdust or dried glue, I flipped the sled
            around and onto the comically small table. I then cleaned off the top
            surface to remove any lingering particles. After that I put the stock
            that will eventually become the spoilboard onto the wooden piece. This
            stock had a few knicks in it so I used some left over mdf sawdust and
            wood glue to fill it up. Then I took the spoilboard and centered it on
            the board. This gave me the sled, fully operational.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Lowrider CNC was now ready to be mounted on the sled, I was really
            nervous, what if I had miscalculated by an inch or so, it has happened
            before. I decided to attach the z-rods and then took the entire assembly
            and put it on the table. I first panicked when I tried to put the CNC
            from the top and then realized that there was no way that this would
            have worked. After sliding the CNC from the side everything....worked
            out! I was relieved. The only minor issue was that in certain places,
            the Y-axis movement was not perfectly smooth, however this is probably
            just b/c the machine hasn't been fully squared yet. After this I tested
            the X, Y, and Z motion, all of which worked perfectly. Then I lowered
            the gantry to the lowest position and started looking for flat spots or
            irregularities. Besides, the one I found earlier, I didn't find any
            others.
        </p>
        <p>
            I placed the router in and thought a little bit about how I would manage
            the cabling. I decided that the router would probably be plugged into a
            ceiling outlet while the machine would probably be plugged into any
            other outlet. I also contemplated adding integrated wiring, but realized
            that is something that I would do later.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am so relieved that this part worked and can't wait to begin the
            wiring, I'll probably end up asking my friend who already built his on
            how to cable manage the CNC. Here are a few shots and videos that
            showcase the kinematics in action!

        <h4>Day 6: 1/8</h4>

        <p>
            Welp, it's been a whole year since I've worked on this, damn time goes
            by quickly... With the junior year crunch starting, I'm getting less and
            less time to work on the CNC, but you know what, I said I'm gonna do it,
            so I am. Also happy new year. Hope 2021 is better than 2020 (Dre and
            Capital Insurrection 🤔)
        </p>
        <p>
            Before I can work on wiring up the stepper motors and etc I first have
            to attach and tension the belts. Future Vedansh here, skip the next
            paragraph if you want to avoid my rant about why electronics look ugly*.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my (mechanically minded) opinion, electronics ruin the looks of the
            machine (*if not done properly). Most of the machines that I have seen
            and have worked on are mechanically focused and have little thought
            given to the electronics — a infamous saying during robotics design
            reviews is: “Electronics will figure something out”. As a result, most
            designs don't actually try to conceal the wiring and more often then
            not, the smooth powder coat and painted accents don't look as good after
            everything has been plugged in. My goal has always been to try and make
            my mechanical design as easy as possible for anyone who is (unfortunate
            enough to be) working with me, so that they can perform their best.
            Since I am doing basically all the mechanical and electrical work, I
            thought I may as well make the wiring look as clean as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyways, the belts add character to the machine, unlike most (but not
            my) electronics (see my rant above, if you skipped).
        </p>
        <p>
            To attach the belts I first created a loop on the belt spool, this took
            a bit of finesse and I omitted a 3D printed spacer because it serves
            little purpose. After attaching the belt with a zip-tie (I started with
            the x-axis) to one side, I realized the mistake I made. The large spool
            won't fit through the ~5 mm opening that serves to attach the belt to
            the pulley. I had to cut off the section that I just made and I first
            spent 10 min trying to put the belt through the pulley— at least a
            friend came over and helped tremendously with getting everything to go
            in.

        <p>What the loop looks like.</p>
        <p>
            After redoing the loop, cutting the belt to size (if I cut at the end of
            the axis, it's just long enough), adding another loop, and tensioning
            the belt, I was finished with the X-axis. This is what the CNC now looks
            like from a top view!

            After completing the X-axis, I started work on the Y-axis, specifically
            both of the rails. This CNC has 2 Y-axes. I call them Y1 (or Y left) and
            Y2 (or Y right). To attach the belts, we need to attach the anchors to
            the table. This is also what the machine uses to self-square. I started
            by aligning the 3D printed part to the edge of the table then drilling
            the holes. This took a bit of trial and error (though the error was
            mostly me just not feeling confident), but eventually I drilled the
            holes for one of the pieces.

            In a rush to try and move on the other side, I used an impact driver to
            put the screws in. This was a huge mistake. Since I was using a
            countersunk head screw with a non-countersunk plastic piece, there was a
            point of high stress, and since I forgot to stop right before I hit the
            plastic, the piece cracked. Shit. I was frustrated that I was gonna need
            to print another of this model, but then it occurred to me, this piece
            is gonna be experiencing little if any stress. So I just chucked a clamp
            on the piece to prevent the print from splitting any more and decided to
            manually tighten it with a good ol' fashioned screwdriver. This is how
            it looked:

            I did the same thing on the other side. Just to make sure that this
            didn't loosen over time, I coated each screw in a thin layer of wood
            glue, this would hopefully add a little bit of strength and fill in any
            gaps, mostly the one between the wood and the plastic, reducing the
            destructive potential of potential weak points. I then added the belt,
            this time threading it through the, somehow even more tight, y-axis.
            This is the crazy path we needed to push the belt though:

            I thought I'd be able to continue with the electronics, but
            unfortunately I had to wait for mounting hardware, in the meanwhile, I
            disassembled the CNC (I just removed the carriage from the Z-axis (which
            uses lead screws rather than belts). This left me with an assembly that
            looks like this:
