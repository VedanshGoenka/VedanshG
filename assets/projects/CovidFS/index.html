        <h4>The Idea: Written on May 1st 2020</h4>
        <p>
            When Covid-19 first struck it disrupted our entire way of life: no more
            in-person school, meeting with friends, politics, healthcare, etc. There
            was little that I could do to help, and this feeling of helplessness
            made me extremely uncomfortable. If the world is gonna stop, that
            doesn’t mean that I also need to stop, I need to pick up the pace and
            make the best of my quarantine. I looked back through everything that
            was happening to see if I could do anything: schools closed, can’t do
            anything about it; friends socially distanced, hang out using the
            internet; politics, advocacy won’t do much given the circumstances;
            healthcare, well maybe there is something that I can do here...
        </p>
        <p>
            I started scouring the internet looking for ways to help front line
            workers...make masks, volunteer, print face shields, donate,
            advocate—wait go back, print face shields? I can do that! I had just
            gotten my 3D printer, and my lust for printing things was not even close
            to being satiated. I started my research by going to
            <a href="https://www.prusaprinters.org/" target="_blank"
            >prusaprinters.org </a
            >and seeing what the good folks at Prusa Research were doing. I was
            blown away by the impact they had, close to 100,000 face shields were
            going to be delivered in the next few weeks! I suddenly became extremely
            inspired, this was something I feel compelled to do, not for my sake,
            but for the sake of others! I immediately started sketching what I
            needed to do to organize something of the sort, during the course of my
            research, I stumbled upon the website of
            <a href="https://www.covidshieldnexus.org/" target="_blank"
            >Makers Nexus</a
            >, one of my friends who also had a 3D printer said that he used to go
            there and knew that they were doing something with Covid-19. After
            filling out all of the required forms I had my task, make as many face
            shields as possible.

        <h4>
            The Execution: Written on May 4th 2020 (May the Force be with You)
        </h4>
        <p>
            I just received the files to print and each of these parts for the face
            shields take ~20 hours! That means that I can only do ~40 or so a day,
            which is horrible efficiency. The slicer profile they provided brings
            this up to ~52 in 24 hours, let me see if I can make this better....
        </p>
        <p>
            Well that was pretty fun, trying different settings to try to increase
            the printing speed of the mask. One of the 3D printing YouTubers that I
            watch,

            >extremely helpful video</a
            >
            with a lot of helpful tips and tricks. Using these and making a deep
            dive on the settings of the slicer I was able to boost the number of
            masks from the Maker Nexus profile of 37 parts every ~17 hours to an
            astonishing 37 parts every 7 hours and 28 min!

            />
        </a>
        <p>Here are the tweaks that I made to speed up the process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Remove all infill </strong>- the closely spaced line needs to
                be approached slowly, rather than using solid infill, use 0%.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Max out the perimeters</strong> - By setting this to an
                obscene number (I set it to 8), the entire model will only be
                consisting of perimeters, these being long curves allowing the printer
                to accelerate to a much higher average velocity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bottom Solid Layer = </strong><strong>3</strong
            ><strong> ⇒ 2 </strong>- This is all that is needed, this is a
                necessary slowdown.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Increase the Layer height (use variable) </strong>- Allows for
                0.32 thick layers where there is low detail and this goes down to 0.2
                mm layers when detail is needed. Manually controlling this gives
                unparalleled quality and plaid speeds.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Disable Skirt</strong> - Manually watch the first layer,
                allows me to fit one more part.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add brim & turn up first layer speed</strong>
                - brim adds ~3 min, speed increase removes ~15+ min. Need to do both
                for reliability.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tune Speeds </strong>- Push machine to the limits (~80-120
                mm/s)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Increase Extrusion Width </strong>- The secret sauce allows
                you to have thicker layers (in the XY direction). It also allows you
                to:
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Remove gap fill</strong> - Takes too long, machine needs to go
                &lt; 30 mm/s. This reduced ~4 hours with Extrusion Width!
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Increase Temperatures</strong> - Stronger layer adhesion,
                reduces surface quality but this doesn’t matter
            </li>
            <li><strong>Level Bed</strong> - Ensures perfect adhesion.</li>
            <li>
                <strong
                >Set up a schedule for printing, and count filament usage - </strong
                >This allows the machine to pump out as many parts without having
                filament runouts. My schedule was 7:30AM &rarr; 3:00PM &rarr; 10:30 PM
                &rarr; Repeat. I can do 8 prints on a spool.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With all of these tweaks I am able to do 3 sets of 37 each day, even
            accounting for the occasional failure this means that I can do ~110 a
            day—a HUGE step up from the ~52 that Makers Nexus’s profile allowed me
            to do. After sharing this profile with others, people were also able to
            drastically increase the number of face shields that they can produce
            each day. After printing my trial batch, I dropped this off today and
            got some blue filament to print more from. Here is a short
            <a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VoA5YfenvUc">video</a>
            of my printer printing the initial black batch.
        </p>
        <p>
            My second batch was a batch of ~300. This is one of the last batches
            that I took a photo of.

        <p>
            The friend that initially informed me about Makers Nexus just let me
            know that he has also been printing components! Together, we recruited
            another one of our mutual friends and we all have been trading tips,
            discussing techniques, and just talking about things every so often. Our
            goal as a collective is to print ~3k components. I also set up a camera
            for monitoring, this camera can also do timelapses, though it isn’t
            meant to do this. I have attached all current (and will attach all
            future face shield timelapses) at the end of this post.
        </p>
        <h4>Written on May 20th 2020</h4>
        <p>
            Since the last entry I have delivered 2 batches as I got 2 boxes of
            filament (you can see them in the previous picture). This brings the
            total that I have delivered to 150 (initial black) + 297 (blue) + 278
            (pink) + 296 (pink). This means that I have delivered enough parts for
            ~1021 face shields! Barring the ~5% failure rate of these, that means
            that I have delivered ~969 components! I picked up 1 more box of pink
            and a box of white and will start printing once I get home! (<em

        <p>
            I just received an email from Makers Nexus stating that they have
            fulfilled ALL of their orders! My final tally (with the batch that I
            just dropped off) is 1207 components! While I didn't contribute as much
            as some others did, people who had larger printers and multiple
            printers, I feel very proud knowing that I contributed ~1.2k components
            of the ~160k 3D printed components needed (each shield is 2 printed
            components and one visor, one of the printed components was replaced
            with an injection molded component around May 16th). Of the components
            that I contributed, I contributed ~1k of the ~80k components that they
            received!

        <p>
            After speaking with my friends, we ended up producing a bit more than
            our goal of 3k! This is really exciting for me and I feel much more
            confident going into the summer Covid-19! We have all played a part in
            helping healthcare workers stay safer in the front lines. I am more
            motivated than ever to continue using my 3D printer to create new and
            exciting things, things that benefit not only myself, but thousands of
            others. This experience is one that I will never forget and has cemented
            to me the power of a 3D printer.
