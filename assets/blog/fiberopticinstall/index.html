                Summer Break is like one long weekend, one of the projects that I
                observed and found really interesting was the installation of a fiber
                optic cable at home for the internet.

            We were using a comcast subscription and had maxed out the speed quota,
            100/10 (this means 100 mbps down and 10 mbps up). AT&T fiber promises
            1000/1000! That is 10x the download speed and 100x the upload speed of
            what I previously had! <span id="dots-fiber"> ...</span>

          There is a terminal right behind my mailbox, this terminal has all of
          the fiber for the 4 houses served by the mailbox. A technician came
          and ran 2 wires to an outlet in our house. One across the sidewalk and
          parallel to the control box, then one connecting the first wire to the
          outside control box. The problem that arose was that there was no
          power to the control box outside, this meant that we either had to
          bring power outside or we had to snake the cable upstairs to where
          there is power. The better option is to bring the fiber up, but the
          contractor was unwilling to do this. We ended up just closing shop and
          started pondering solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We looked into POE and other crude methods to bring power down. In a
          vain attempt to check if there was a connection between the top area
          and the outside control box, I used some old 3d printing filament and
          ran it down, due to the flexible nature of the filament, it just
          coiled up and nothing was discovered. We hoped that the next person
          would either condone our macgyvered solution or be willing to try
          fishing the cable through the wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily the next person that came was a kind filipino soul who was
          really willing to try anything and had an air of confidence around
          him. He seemed knowledgeable and was willing to try risks and unlike
          the other person who came, he trusted my dad and I and was willing to
          try to snake the cable through. This eventually worked and knowing
          that this was possible was both a relief and mildly infuriating as we
          could have had all of this figured out a few days ago.
        </p>

          After snaking the cable up, the fiber optic cable was terminated and
          turned into copper. The signal is then sent downstairs underneath the
          TV to where the modem and router are, the signal is then split into 4
          networks, the best way to describe them are the following:
        </p>
        <p>AT&T Router - Speeds of ~950/950 wired</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>"Unsecure Devices and Entertainment"</strong> - This was
            both wired and wireless and is used by most devices at home (phones,
            laptops, etc)
          </li>
          <li><strong>"Guest"</strong> - The guest network, wireless only</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The Apple router - Speeds of ~300/300 wired (not gigabit capable,
          upgrade soon)
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>"Secure user devices"</strong> - This is basically the
            entire house's ethernet and is used by laptops that are docked (mine
            and my dad's) and other devices such as the Raspberry Pi's. Both
            wired and wireless.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>"Secure devices"</strong> - Wifi devices that need to be
            isolated.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The Apple router signal is sent back upstairs into a network switch
          which then supplies ethernet to the rest of the upstairs. This
          topology took a while to figure out, but it seems to work quite well.

          The thing that baffles me the most is just how thin a fiber optic
          cable really is. The shielding makes it seem impossibly thick, but in
          reality it is so thin, you can barely see it. Here's a photo of it
          unshielded:
        </p>
        <p>
          The fiber optic cable isn't the white thing, it's about ~9 pixels in
          size inside the white cable! My phone was barely able to capture it!

          I thoroughly enjoyed this project because I learned a lot about fiber
          optic cables and how they are routed.
