                Throughout my life the thing that has fascinated me the most is
                space, the final frontier. Often I have been obsessed with recent
                developments related to space. In 2017, I flew 600 miles, missed
                effectively 2 days of school,  and then drove back 600 miles just to
                witness a phenomena that lasted approx. 159 sec.

            I had initially thought, prior to 2018, that most of the photos taken
            of space was with multi-thousand ($10k+) gear; I wasn’t entirely
            wrong, but during my trip planning for the (cancelled) New Zealand
            trip, I learned that a regular DSLR is able to take stunning photos of
            the milky way, the ones that I originally thought were taken on
            satellites. During this time I had ironed out my method of figuring
            out if a spot was a good place to take photos of the stars. The rough
            method that I had devised was:<span id="dots-astro19">..</span>

            The car ride there is something that would haunt me in the days that
            followed. My dad and I were talking about going to the gilroy garlic
            festival the following day, assuming that we would return from the
            state park on time. We had pretty much agreed to go as long as both
            of us were up by 9:30. We slept in and didn’t end up going. At
            around 6:00 PM that day we heard the news that honestly frightened
            me more than I could have imagined, there was the shooting at the
            Gilroy Garlic Festival. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The road up to the state park was a winding road filled with
            hundreds of hairpin turns. It was both electrifying and terrifying
            at the same time. It was pretty incredible to see the view from up
            here. The other thing that surprised me was the sheer number of
            people who were living so high up. What must their commute be like?
            Do they all work from home?

            About 3/4th of the way up I started feeling a little nauseated so we
            pulled over, this is exactly when the sun was setting and I was able
            to get a bunch of absolutely stunning photos of the lake below.
            These were all taken on my phone (Samsung Galaxy S10 w/ GCam Mod).

            After getting to the top of the hill and entering the state park, I
            initially tried to capture a photo with my phone. This ended up not
            working as the exposure time was too short, there was movement of
            the camera, and I had no way to mount my phone to a tripod—if only I
            had a 3D printer...
          </p>
          <a href="#astro19-5">
            <img
                    alt="A fail"
                    class="row col-9 col-sm-8 col-md-5 mx-auto"
                    loading="lazy"
                    src="assets/blog/astrophotography2019/blurry.jpg"
            />
          </a>
          <a class="lb" href="#_" id="astro19-5">
            <img
                    loading="lazy"
                    src="assets/blog/astrophotography2019/blurry.jpg"
            />
          </a>
          <p>
            Even though the milky way was clearly visible, the image had little
            definition and the milky way in this photo may as well have been a
            smudge on the lens. 
          </p>
          <p>
            After swapping to a DSLR the milky way suddenly much more
            pronounced. Although I have to admit I was initially disappointed by
            the results that I had gotten. I had expected to get an output
            similar to what you might see when you google “Milky Way Photos”,
            just with lax colors and washed out details; I ended up getting the
            details of the stars, but I would have to do heavy post processing
            to make these images look like what I find on the web. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I used a Nikon D750 with the following setting for most photos: 
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center">ƒ/4    20s   24mm   ISO1600</p>
          <p>
            I varied the focal length to follow the 300 rule. My max exposure
            time should be around 300 divided by the focal length. Based on what
            I ended up getting, this dictated my shutter speed. To then adjust
            the overall exposure I would change the aperture first, then change
            the ISO. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent the next hour or so taking pictures of the milky way, some
            without changing anything and others while changing elements. We
            ended up leaving the state park at around 1:30. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The photos that I got were not impressive initially, but after
            playing with sliders in Lightroom, I was able to pull out much more
            detail that I expected. Only after editing the photos I finally
            realized the extent to which many of these photos are edited. I
            wasn’t comfortable with trying any advanced image manipulation
            techniques so I stuck to simply editing photos in Lightroom and
            Photoshop. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The first image that I edited ended up looking like this, I am
            extremely proud of the results. 
          </p>

            />
          </a>
          <p>
            I used a flashlight and turned it on for ~5 sec of the 20 sec
            exposure. When the flashlight hit particles of dust in the air, it
            illuminated the path of the flashlight. This makes it look like the
            milky way is being illuminated by the flashlight. 
          </p>
          <p>I edited the photos following the same procedure:</p>
          <p>
            Play with the sliders until I get what I like, do this 2 to 3 times
            for each photo and be sure to touch every slider. I made the obvious
            changes before doing this (exposure, contrast, levels, etc), but for
            much of the minute detail I ended up just “randomly” seeing what
            works. According to Peter McKinnon, a resource I found extremely
            helpful, this is more or less what he does, although he knows to an
            mucher better degree what each of these sliders do. Here are a few
            more photos that I am proud of:
