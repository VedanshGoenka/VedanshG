                Throughout my life the thing that has fascinated me the most is
                space, the final frontier. Often I have been obsessed with recent
                developments related to space. In 2017, I flew 600 miles, missed
                effectively 2 days of school,  and then drove back 600 miles just to
                witness a phenomena that lasted approx. 159 sec.

            I had initially thought, prior to 2018, that most of the photos taken
            of space was with multi-thousand ($10k+) gear; I wasn’t entirely
            wrong, but during my trip planning for the (cancelled) New Zealand
            trip, I learned that a regular DSLR is able to take stunning photos of
            the milky way, the ones that I originally thought were taken on
            satellites. During this time I had ironed out my method of figuring
            out if a spot was a good place to take photos of the stars. The rough
            method that I had devised was:<span id="dots-astro19">..</span>
