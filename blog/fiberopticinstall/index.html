                Summer Break is like one long weekend, one of the projects that I
                observed and found really interesting was the installation of a fiber
                optic cable at home for the internet.

            We were using a comcast subscription and had maxed out the speed quota,
            100/10 (this means 100 mbps down and 10 mbps up). AT&T fiber promises
            1000/1000! That is 10x the download speed and 100x the upload speed of
            what I previously had! <span id="dots-fiber"> ...</span>
