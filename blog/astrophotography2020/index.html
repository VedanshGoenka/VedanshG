                Ah yes, Coronavirus, on a mission to restrict our summers... Here’s
                everything that I can remember happening: Bushfires, Kobe, Covid-19,
                Trump’s Impeachment, BLM, Stock Market... I probably forgot a bunch of
                stuff, but whatever; I sincerely hope the worst is behind us.

            Last year, I went up to Henry M. Coe State Park to capture the milky
            way, this time I want to up my game, raise the bar. This year, just
            around the same time as the Milky Way will be primed to be shot another
            phenomena will be visible, C/2020 F3 (colloquially known as NEOWISE,
            named after a mission by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)
            space telescope). Of the many comets that are projected to be visible,
            NEOWISE is one of the few that will actually reach Earth and be visible,
            at least until it sees the appalling state of humanity and decides to
            get as far away as possible. Until that day comes, which should be by
            the end of the month, I have the enticing opportunity to paint both the
            Milky Way and NEOWISE on my camera’s sensor.<span id="dots-astro20"
